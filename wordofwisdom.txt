The best way out is always through.
Carpe Diem.
Always Do What You Are Afraid To Do.
Believe and act as if it were impossible to fail.
Keep steadily before you the fact that all true success depends at last upon yourself.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
Opportunity is always knocking. The problem is that most people have the self-doubt station in their heads turned up way too loud to hear it.
You must be the change you wish to see in the world.
Tough times never last, but tough people do.
You must not only aim right, but draw the bow with all your might.
Everyone has inside them a piece of good news. The good news is you don’t know how great you can be! How much you can love! What you can accomplish! And what your potential is.
Soon, when all is well, you’re going to look back on this period of your life and be so glad that you never gave up.
You must never be fearful about what you are doing when it is right.
Strive not to be a success but rather to be of value.
The best revenge is massive success.
It is time for us all to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever – the one who recognizes the challenges and does something about it.
The harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.
